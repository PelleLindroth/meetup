## **User stories**
### All users

**<em>get an overview of what's happening in the near future and what has happened in the past</em>**

- As a user I want to<br/>
**<em>be able to click on an event to see its details</em>**<br/>
so I can<br/>
**<em>investigate the event further and sign up</em>**

- As a user I want to<br/> 
**<em>clearly see what events have already occured</em>**<br/>

**<em>check the details of the date or try to sign up to past events</em>**
